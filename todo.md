* find out how the package system should work, and how the build target should be specified
* determine how int and uint should work
* overloads should not be destinguished by param name, since this could cause nondeterministic compilation
* call conv notation, inline type or decl?
* vtable for metaprogramming?
* experiment with simd
* add sign extend + n bit masks
* how should $ident be handled by the parser and checker?
* how should volatile be implemented?
